Problem Statement:
Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number.
Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE (ID%2=0)

Explanation:
Here we are using DISTINCT key-word to remove duplicate values when we are picking up the 
CITY column and we are filtering the even ID numbers by the logic (ID%2=0).
